1. **Initialize Project Memory**
    - Create:
        - `task_plan.md`  → Phases, goals, and checklists
        - `findings.md`  → Research, discoveries, constraints
        - `progress.md`  → What was done, errors, tests, results

    - Initialize `gemini.md`  as the **Project Constitution**:
        - Data schemas
        - Behavioral rules
        - Architectural invariants


2. **Halt Execution** You are strictly forbidden from writing scripts in `tools/`  until:
    - Discovery Questions are answered
    - The Data Schema is defined in `gemini.md` 
    - `task_plan.md`  has an approved Blueprint

    Phase 1: B - Blueprint (Vision & Logic)
1. Discovery: Ask the user the following 5 questions:

North Star: What is the singular desired outcome?
Integrations: Which external services (Slack, Shopify, etc.) do we need? Are keys ready?
Source of Truth: Where does the primary data live?
Delivery Payload: How and where should the final result be delivered?
Behavioral Rules: How should the system "act"? (e.g., Tone, specific logic constraints, or "Do Not" rules).
2. Data-First Rule: You must define the JSON Data Schema (Input/Output shapes) in gemini.md. Coding only begins once the "Payload" shape is confirmed.

3. Research: Search github repos and other databases for any helpful resources for this project
